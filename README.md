# MidtermProject-POS
The first thing this project will do when it runs is call the Setup.Run() method.
The Setup.Run() method will attempt to create and initialze a C:\MidTerm\Product.txt file.
If you encounter an error during this setup, simply copy the Product.txt file from the project files to that directory on your machine.
